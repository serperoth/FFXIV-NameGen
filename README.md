# FFXIV-NameGen
Name Generator for Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn

A simple name generator for Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn
Names will be implemented as a list of possible first names and last names for some races, or as a 'true' generator for others.

Specifically:
Hyur names, both Midlander and Highlander, are going to be drawn from pools, first names and last names. Eight pools in total (male-female, Highlander-Midlander, first-last)
Elezen names, both Wildwood and Duskwright, are going to be drawn from pools, similar to Hyur names. Possible change later, if it can be figured out.

Lalafell names are going to be generated, according to the rules of each, with appropriate last names.
Roegadyn names are going to be generated, with Sea Wolf names using the Roegadyn dictionary provided
Miqo'te names are going to be generated, according to the rules for them all.

The name pools for Hyur and Elezen, as well as the dictionaries for Miqo'te and Roegadyn are possibly going to be limited, due to memory concerns.
